## This repository was created during the courses ["Python Programming"](https://stepik.org/course/67/), ["Python: Basics and Applications"](https://stepik.org/course/512/) from Bioinformatics Institute (St. Petersburg) and ["Algorithms: theory and practice"](https://stepik.org/course/217/) from Computer Science Center (St. Petersburg)
### About ["Python Programming"](https://stepik.org/course/67/) course:
The course is devoted to the basic concepts and elements of the Python programming language (operators, numeric and string variables, lists, conditions and loops).
Also in the course there are several tasks of increased complexity, which are optional for the course, but those who wish will be able to smash their heads over 
coming up with algorithms and implementing programs for these tasks.

### About ["Python: Basics and Applications"](https://stepik.org/course/512/) course:
In this course, you will learn the fundamental principles of the Python language: how the interpreter executes code, where it stores variables and data, 
how its own data types and functions are defined - all of this we will uncover. You know, it is impossible to learn programming without practice, so as homework 
assignments you will be offered tasks of varying complexity and focus: some to consolidate the material, and others to develop ingenuity and find a way 
to apply the material you've just learned.

- [x] **2. Python Standard Tools**
  - 2.1. Errors and exceptions
  - 2.2. Working with code: modules and imports
  - 2.3. Iterators and generators
  - 2.4. Working with the file system and files
  - 2.5. Working with functions: functool and lambda functions
  - 2.6. Programming style: pep8 and documentation
- [x] **3. Python Applications: Analyzing Text**
  - 3.1. Experiment with Slack Communication
  - 3.2. Standard methods and functions for strings
  - 3.3. Regular Expressions in Python
  - 3.4. Overview of the Internet: http requests, html pages, and requests library

### About ["Algorithms: theory and practice"](https://stepik.org/course/217/) course:
The course will cover in detail the basic algorithmic methods: greedy algorithms, divide and conquer method, dynamic programming. For all algorithms, 
correctness and estimates will be mathematically rigorously proven. In addition to the theoretical foundations, the intricacies of the implementation 
of algorithms in the programming languages C++, Java and Python will be discussed. We will also show you how to test your code. By solving our tasks, 
you will gain valuable experience in writing and debugging efficient and reliable programs. Finally, the course also includes advanced tasks - less standard 
tasks that are not required for the course. Those who are already familiar with basic algorithms can also enjoy solving these tasks.
